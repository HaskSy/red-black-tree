# Red-Black Tree

Standard red-black tree implementation. For now supports only addition of non-duplicate values. 

This implementation was made especially for JetBrains Internships 2021


# Testing

to run tests using console:
 * Please launch tests from the root directory of project
 * If you want to run all test files (well now there is only one), then type in console:
```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```
 * If you want to run one exact test, then, for example, type:
```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_RBTree.py
```
